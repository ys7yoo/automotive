# 4.4.1. SWE.1 Software Requirements Analysis (p. 47)


## Outputs
### Interface requirements specification (17-08)

* Defines relationships between two products, process or process tasks
* Defines criteria and format for what is common to both
* Defines critical timing dependencies or sequence ordering
* Description of the physical interfaces of each system component like:
  - bus interfaces (CAN, MOST, LIN, Flexray etc.)
  - transceiver (type, manufacturer, etc.)
  - analogue interfaces
  - digital interfaces (PWM, I/O)
  - additional interfaces (IEEE, ISO, Bluetooth, USB, etc.)
* Identification of the software interfaces of software components and other software item in terms of:
  - inter-process communication mechanisms
  - bus communication mechanisms
